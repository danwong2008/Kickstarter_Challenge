## Overview

In this project, we helped Louise to analyze datas and conclude with two sets of results; "Theather Outcomes by Launch Date" and "Outcomes Based on Goals".

# Analysis & Challenges

## Analysis

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

This section of results shows:

* There is a steady increase in successful rate between the month of March and May, and May is the peak of the year for sucessful rate. It will then start to decrease with December hit the lowest point.

* May and October have the highest failed rate, base on the resuilts both of the month have nearly 50% failed rate. We need more data info to further investigate to find the reasoning.

* Throughout the year, there are minimal cancel rate, with January being the highest.

### Outcomes Based on Goals

This section of results shows:

* The highest successfull rate based on goals were less than $1000 (76%), with the lowest successful rate at $45,000 to $49,999 (0%).

* There were no cancel rate.

### Challenges

* The possible challenges that Louise may face will be, eventhough the data shows promising results in theatrical campings, but when it's break down into "play" subcategory; it is noticeable that the percentage successful rate is not the greatest. So Louise will have to face the challenge on how to boost her successful rate in "play".

## Conclusion

### Theather Outcomes by Launch Date

* In conclusion, May is the most successful month and with December being the most unsuccessful month.

* Although cancel rate remain low, January had the most cancel rate.

### Outcomes Based on Goals

* In conclusion, when the goal is set to $50,000 or more the failure rate is at 100%.
